```{r}
tchrAsstData = read.table("hw02data1.txt", header=TRUE)
```


```{r}
which(is.na(tchrAsstData), arr.ind = TRUE)
```


```{r}
#
tchrAsstData = na.omit(tchrAsstData)

nrow(tchrAsstData)
```


```{r}
mean(tchrAsstData[,6])
```


```{r}
unique(tchrAsstData[,7])
```


```{r}
# sampling

# 1. Calculate the mean value of the classSize
mean(tchrAsstData[,6])

# 2. Sample 10 records without replacement using the R command sample.
sample(tchrAsstData[, 6], 10)
```
```{r}
nrow(tchrAsstData)
```


```{r}
# 3. write a function that takes a parameter for the number of samples and the mean (you can use the
# value from #1). In the function use a for loop that iterates 10 times. 
# - Each time it will sample the number of records using the parameter. 
# - Each time you sample, calculate the mean value of classSize. 
# - Calculate the absolute value of the difference between this mean from the parameter
# mean. After the loop, return the average of the differences calculated in the loop.

avgDiffSample = function(numOfSamples, meanNum) {
  result = c()
  for (item in 1:10) {
    # Each time it will sample the number of records using the parameter
    newSample = sample(tchrAsstData[,6], numOfSamples)
    # Each time you sample, calculate the mean value of classSize
    newMeanNum = mean(newSample)
    # calculate the absolute value of the difference between this mean from the parameter
    diff = abs(newMeanNum - meanNum)
    # append to result vector
    result = c(result, diff)
    
  }
  # return the average of the differences calculated in the loop.
  return( mean(result) )
}

avgDiffSample(100, mean(tchrAsstData[, 6]))
